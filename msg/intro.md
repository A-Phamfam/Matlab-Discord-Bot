__**Help**__

Most questions can be answered by googling "matlab + your question".

If you still need help, ask your question in <#450928036800364546>, <#456342124342804481> or <#456342247189774338>.

__**Bot Commands**__

Use bot commands in <#453522391377903636>. Write `!help` in chat to get a list of all commands.

__**Posting Code in Chat**__

When posting code in chat, wrap your code in three *backticks* and add *matlab* after the first three for syntax highlighting. For example typing:

\`\`\`matlab
for ii = 1:10
    disp(ii);
end%for ii
\`\`\`

Results in:
```matlab
for ii = 1:10
    disp(ii);
end%for ii
``` For longer code drag your m-files directly into chat or use <https://pastebin.com>. You can also save your workspace variables as a mat-file and drag that directly into chat as well.
