__**Asking For Help**__
Most questions can be answered by googling "matlab + your question".

If you still need help, ask your question fully outright in any relevant channel labeled `help` that is not busy. Be sure to provide all relevant code and material when asking.

**Do not ping other users for help.** People who want and are willing to help will read the chat.

__**Bot Commands**__
Use bot commands in <#453522391377903636>. Write `!help` in chat to get a list of all commands.

__**Posting Code in Chat**__
When posting code in chat, wrap your code in three *backticks* and add *matlab* after the first three for syntax highlighting. For example typing:

\`\`\`matlab
    foobar = [1:10]; %comment
\`\`\`

Results in:
```matlab
    foobar = [1:10]; %comment
```
