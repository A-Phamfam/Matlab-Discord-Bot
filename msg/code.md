Wrap your code in three backticks to post code into Discord chat. Activate syntax highlighting for MATLAB code by adding "matlab" after the first three backticks.

\`\`\`matlab
foobar = [1:10]; %comment
\`\`\`

The example above results in:
```matlab
foobar = [1:10]; %comment
```
For longer code paste your `.m` and `.mat` files directly into chat or use <https://pastebin.com>.
