To maximise the chances of getting your question answered, you need to structure it in a way that makes it easy for people to help.

1) Post your question with as much detail as possible.
2) Share code you have written so far.
3) If you're getting an error message, share the error message.
4) Bonus points if you share the link you've tried to understand after googling "matlab + your question".
